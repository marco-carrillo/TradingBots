TradingBots application targets high-volume traders who wants to simplify trading through a nimble interface and customizable analytics. 
Our application allows users to setup pre-established strategies for getting trading tips.  On demand, the user can check if any stocks trading meet the pre-established conditions that user setup originally, and check sources of news to understand if there has been negative or positive news that could explain changes in stock price and volume.
